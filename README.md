PULSE
===========

# You snooze, you loose!
We have a tendency to push our limits and not accept the negatives. In our everyday lives, it allows us to push further. However, on the road, this behavior doesnâ€™t translate well. Almost a third of the accidents on Indian roads are because drivers are either unable, or ignorant, in identifying that they are sleepy and continue to drive nevertheless. The magnitude goes up when you look at the truckers, where the wages rely on getting goods from A to B earliest. Truckers willingly drive for as much as 20 hours a day under pressure which results into shocking 57 percent of casualties in trucking-related accidents being caused by drowsy driving.

Leading auto companies address this with complicated solutions involving multiple cameras and sensors fitted to premium cars, accessible to less than 1 percent of the car buyers in India. We are tackling drowsy driving by using basic fitness trackers and using the heart rate data to identify when the driver is drowsy, or drunk.

The heart rate starts dropping as a person starts getting sleepy allowing us to identify drowsy drivers. The data is used to send audio and visual alerts. The Android app, which will also be rolled out as an SDK, also tracks for how long someone has been driving, and sends a prompt to take a break. The entire tech solution would minimize the incidents of drowsy driving by prompting people to take breaks during long drives and alerting them when they are drowsy.

* You're more likely to die from drowsy driving than from texting while driving, distracted driving or drunk driving combined
* The results show that many drivers ignore official advice from the NHAI to take a 15-mins break every two hours on a long journey.
* Existing solutions are vision based and expensive
* Cops cant detect drowsy drivers like they can detect drunk drivers

## Our Solution
* Tracking the Pulse of the driver and detecting whether the driver is sleepy or not
* Using the existing fitness band with heart rate sensors to do that

## Why is our Solution feasible?
* No additional hardware required
* An already existing fitness band market is expected to grow
* The fitness bands value proposition adds to road safety
* Can work offline as Indian Highways have patchy networks

## Tech stack used
* Java (Android)
* Connecting to Smart bands using BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)
* Detecting drowsiness through Pulse Rate
* GPS Tracking

## Potential impact
* Reduced accidents due to drowsiness using:
    *  Pulse rate tracking and alerting user if he seems drowsy
    *  Timely alerts if he is driving for long hours continuously
    *  Tapping into the competitive nature of people by Gamifying the driving behaviour and motivate them to drive better
* Fitness band turned Life-saver
